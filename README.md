# 🐍 Python Simplicity Patterns

Welcome to the chill zone of clean code ✨

This repo is all about showing how to *do less but better* in Python. Each folder breaks down a concept — showing the "old way" (aka overcomplicated chaos 😬) versus a modern, minimal, *actually nice to read* version.

## 🧱 Structure

* Every folder = one theme (like `rule_engine` or `lazy_loading`)
* Inside, you'll find side-by-side examples:

  * **Old way:** spaghetti code energy 🍝
  * **Modern way:** smooth, elegant, Pythonic vibes 🧘‍♂️

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Install the goodies:

   ```bash
   uv add typeguard hypothesis
   # or
   uv sync
   ```

2. Run examples, poke around, refactor some stuff — get inspired to simplify your own codebase.

## 💡 Contributions

Got ideas? Found an even simpler pattern? PRs are *very* welcome. Let's make Python code so clean it sparkles ✨
